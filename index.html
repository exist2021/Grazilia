                <p>Grazilia has been my yoga guru and life coach for the past two years. She has strengthened my practice of yoga and meditation, advised me on health concerns and prescribed homeopathy. She is warm, nurturing and an expert in the fields of yoga and homeopathy. Her involvement and engagement with is so deep that it is hard to imagine learning yoga from anyone else.</p>

                <p>Grace is a fitness and wellness professional. I enrolled in beginners level yoga class. She was very patient to teach every yoga pose, how to perform the various stretching poses, and practice meditation in an easy way. Classes included enough variety to keep the students interested, engaged and coming back for more. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.</p>

                <p>Dr.Grazilia has the unique quality of wanting to LISTEN to the patient's symptoms, enabling her to treat holistically. Her methods dispel the notion that homeopathy is slow-acting. With her medicines, my complicated medical situation has begun to ease. I can honestly recommend her because I know her approach to wellness WORKS.</p>

                <p>I've trained with her since 2012 and I have loved every class. The work outs are effective without getting repetitive and can be designed to suit specific concerns one might have. The times I had health concerns or restrictions, she ensured there were alternatives/solutions I could consider. Even when I'm trying different work outs or classes elsewhere, I find her sessions to be extremely beneficial</p>

                <p>Dr. Grazilia was very helpful in reversing my Diabetes and so I am very grateful to her. We contact her via Sharan and in our initial consultation she listened to me so patiently. In subsequent interactions, she guided me very carefully on diet and exercise and helped me to get back to normal. She is a doctor who cares about her patient, a rarity in these days, and is also very knowledgeable.</p>
