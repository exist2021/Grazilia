            <h2>My evolution - My Practice</h2>
            <p>It started with the quest for the ‘perfect’ physical posture. I dove into the dynamic styles of Ashtanga and Vinyasa yoga. The focus on alignment and precision in Iyengar yoga later provided me with a solid foundation. After many years of exploring the physical benefits of yoga, I started to notice the more subtle effects of the practice on my mind and emotions. That’s when I started to explore the meditative and restorative aspects of yoga. My practice became more introspective, and I started to see yoga as a tool for self-discovery and personal growth. I began to look for the ‘why’ behind the practice, and to find the answers within myself. I am still on this journey, and I am constantly learning and evolving. My practice is a reflection of my life, and it is constantly changing. I am grateful for the opportunity to share my journey with you.</p>
