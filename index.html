                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>A lifelong passion for movement, I have been practicing yoga since my early 20s. My mother, a yoga teacher, introduced me to the practice, and I have been hooked ever since. My teaching style is a blend of Hatha, Vinyasa, and restorative yoga, with a focus on alignment and breath. I am passionate about helping students find their own unique expression of yoga, and I believe that yoga is for everyone. I am a 500-hour registered yoga teacher, and I have been teaching for over 10 years. I am also a certified yoga therapist, and I specialize in working with students with injuries and chronic pain. I am passionate about sharing the gift of yoga with others, and I believe that yoga can be a powerful tool for healing and transformation. I am also a mother of two, and I love spending time with my family, traveling, and being in nature. I am grateful for the opportunity to share my love of yoga with you.</p>

            <h2>My evolution - My Practice</h2>
            <p>It started with the quest for the ‘perfect’ physical posture. I dove into the dynamic styles of Ashtanga and Vinyasa yoga. The focus on alignment and precision in Iyengar yoga later provided me with a solid foundation. After many years of exploring the physical benefits of yoga, I started to notice the more subtle effects of the practice on my mind and emotions. That’s when I started to explore the meditative and restorative aspects of yoga. My practice became more introspective, and I started to see yoga as a tool for self-discovery and personal growth. I began to look for the ‘why’ behind the practice, and to find the answers within myself. I am still on this journey, and I am constantly learning and evolving. My practice is a reflection of my life, and it is constantly changing. I am grateful for the opportunity to share my journey with you.</p>
